# Foundation for Emails Template

This is the official starter project for [Foundation for Emails](http://foundation.zurb.com/emails), a framework for creating responsive HTML devices that work in any email client. It has a Gulp-powered build system with these features:

- Handlebars HTML templates with [Panini](http://github.com/zurb/panini)
- Simplified HTML email syntax with [Inky](http://github.com/zurb/inky)
- Sass compilation
- Image compression
- Built-in BrowserSync server
- Full email inlining process

## Installation

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
```

## Build Commands

Run `npm start` to kick off the build process. A new browser tab will open with a server pointing to your project files.

Run `npm run build` to inline your CSS into your HTML along with the rest of the build process.

Run `npm run mail` to build as above, then send to specified email address for testing. *SMTP server details required (config.json)*

Run `npm run zip` to build as above, then zip HTML and images for easy deployment to email marketing services.

### Speeding Up Your Build

If you create a lot of emails, your build can start to slow down, as each build rebuilds all of the emails in the
repository. A simple way to keep it fast is to archive emails you no longer need by moving the pages into `src/pages/archive`.
You can also move images that are no longer needed into `src/assets/img/archive`. The build will ignore pages and images that
are inside the archive folder.
